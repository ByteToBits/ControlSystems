This repository contains code from projects from my career as a Control System Engineer.

## C++
- **Description**: A collection of C++ code refactored from Programmable Logic Controllers' (PLCs/PACs) Structured Text Language (IEC-61131 standard).
The code includes state machines, sorting algorithms, and functions to control and sequence Industrial Process Control Systems such as District Cooling Systems, Compressed Dry Air Systems, and various other systems.

## Python
- **Description**: A collection of Python projects designed for a variety of tasks, including Robotics, Internet of Things, data manipulation, and more.
These code are designed with simplicity in mind to simplify or automate simple task.  

## Engie & AWS GenAI Hackathon
- **Description**: This repository features the winning backend code from the Drawing Decoders Team. It leverages AWS services like Bedrock, Rekognition, SageMaker, Lambda, and DynamoDB to extract Equipment X,Y coordinates from Engineering Schematics and optimize Equipment-To-Control-Panel Groupings using a Large Language Model (LLM). A Streamlit front-end enables users to interact with the LLM to draw insights from these schematics and visualize equipment locations.
